      "God, this work retreat is so boring. At least it's almost lunch. Yeah, first there's music. Last year we had Bonnie Raitt, and she was so awesome. Well, this year we've got the Pointer Brothers. Oh. Do they do Pointer Sisters songs? I would assume so. Anything else would be plain stupid. Ladies and gentlemen, please put your warm hands together for the Pointer Brothers! What are they doing? Ladies and gentlemen, we are the Pointer Brothers. And by the end of the night tonight, we promise to point to every person in this arena. Oh, no! That can't be what this is! There's, like, a thousand of us in here. OK, folks. Now, here's how it works. Everybody, stand up. Once you've been pointed at, sit down. Otherwise, there's no way for us to keep track. Or if that doesn't work, throw your hands up. Wait to be pointed. Once you're pointed at, throw that hand back down to the ground. We can't do both. We got to choose one, guys. I kind of like the hand thing. And I like mine. So do they not sing? I think that they just point. That can't be it! All right, folks. Who hasn't been pointed at yet? This is a lot harder to keep track of who I pointed at than I thought. Well, it's not that bad. I pointed at him him her Don't point at them again. It makes it less special. Don't tell me what to do. All right, folks. This is going to take a long time! But nobody is leaving this room until they are pointed at. Waggoo, Waggoo, Waggoo! Oh! Who's that? It's Waggoo! Hey, everybody! Waggoo! Waggoo! Waggoo! Oh, my God! Now, Waggoo hates points. He takes them away. If Waggoo touches you, that brings your point count back down to zero. Throw your hand back up and we will re-point you. And, ladies! Do not let Waggoo touch you. He's not allowed. Not allowed. Do you hear me, Paul? OK, man. Leave me alone. Not after what you did. Now we are going to ask a member of the audience to come up on-stage with us, the Pointer Brothers. So, ma'am, why don't you come on up here? Hurry, though. Let's go! Come on! Come on! Hurry up! There's no stairs to get up. Grab my hand. Come on. Don't make excuses. You got to help. You have to help. You have to help with it. You have to help. You have to help. Come on, get up! Get up! All right, ma'am. Have we pointed at you yet? Yes. Damn it! I was going to point at you, show you how easy it was. OK. We have a lot of pointing to do, so go and take your seat. There's no stairs to get off the stage. Lay down and roll off, then! One of these guys will catch you! Come on, let's go. Go, now! Pronto! Let's go. Get off, get off. Go, go. Shut the fuck up! She's fine! Shut the fuck up, you pieces of shit! fuck up! Do you hear me? Oh, fuck you! Every man in this audience that didn't try to catch her is a fucking coward! Folks, here we go! Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is the part of the evening when one very lucky member of our backstage crew gets to come out here and bring me a water. Sharon? Come on, Sharon! Sharon? Hurry up. Come on, Sharon. Come on, Sharon. Where the hell were you? I was lying down. What is going on with you? Don't go! I am going to give you the bottle back! Sharon, right, everyone? We should fire her, right, folks? We can't. Because of what Waggoo did. She talked to me first, man. Waggoo, are you still out here? How many people have you touched? This whole section. Damn it, Waggoo! That's going to set us back! God damn it! We're in the weeds now, man! Waggoo, you green piece of shit! Who hasn't been pointed at? Are you fucking kidding me? This sucks! You suck! Oh, fuck you, man! You fucking suck! Any of you fucks want it, fight me, you pieces of shit! You suck! This is your wife. This is your wife. That's your wife, man! That's your lady! Fight me! Now!",

      "You're watching the Tampa Bay Wrestling Association. Hi there, Tampa wrestling fans. I'm Rusty Vickers, and tonight we have an exciting match-up. I am here with Fighting Jake Fletcher. Jake, tonight is your rematch with Dump Truck Wallace. The last time you were in the ring together, it was nasty, and he came out on top. Yep. Probably the hardest match I've ever had in my life. But Dump Truck, he tricked me. He didn't follow the rules. So this time, Dump Truck, get in the ring with me and face me like a man. No girlfriend jumping in, no hitting me with a chair. Just man-on-man, hardcore match. This time, I am promising you absolute victory on you! How did it go out there? He beat me. Fair and square. He agreed to all my terms, didn't need any tricks, nobody jumping in. Overpowered me. Simply a stronger man. He kicked out the back of my legs and I hit my head on the mat hard. Let's say that guy is better than me. I don't have to fight him anymore. But do you know who pisses me off? Cosskie the Russian. And when I step into the ring with him next week, I'm going to whoop him! This win's for you, America! What happened? I lost pretty bad. That guy might even be tougher than the first guy. I had to sit out there while Cosskie torched the American flag. I didn't like that one bit. But I got one thing to say to you, Cosskie. Don't spit on me! It's just a game! What are you ? I'll tell you this. Don't do that to me ever again. Did he spit on you? Yep. He kicked me in the head, torched the American flag and spit on me. My beef's not with you, Cosskie. I know you can beat me! I was never arguing that. I think you're awesome. You're huge and fast. Everyone can beat me except one guy. Sheikhzilla. And when I step in the ring with you next week, it's over! You beat me! Who cares? You been doing it way longer. But next week, I got a plan. - How did your plan go, Jake? - It didn't work. He put me in a choke hold and said, \"I'm not letting go until you crap your pants.\" - And then what did you do, Jake? - Crapped my pants. I had to. It was that or be choked to death. But I'll tell you this. If you do that to me again, I'll crap my pants again. I choose it every time. Did he torch the flag, Jake? It goes without saying, Rusty. But I'll tell you this. I am down, but I am not out. Next week, I am going back to Dump Truck Wallace. He kicked me in the back, hit my head, torched the flag. Crapped my pants. But it's not important, what happened this week. It's about next week, when I get in a steel-cage match with Cosskie, Sheikhzilla and Dump Truck. And it's a steel cage, so I can't leave! Cosskie's got him in a hold. He's talking to him, asking him something. Jake's nodding. He's agreeing to it. He's crapped his pants, everybody. Jake's up and mouthing, \"Who cares?\" Here comes the kick in the back. They're torching the American flag, ladies and gentlemen!",

I don't know about this one. What did you want this for? Self-defense. If you say so. Here. Try this one. This is one of our most popular handguns. Oh, it's nice. Well, well, well. Make my day, lady at Red Robin, who said the men's restroom was off-limits for me. Say you were joking. Say I am allowed back in Red Robin, and I didn't do an absolute paint job in the men's restroom. Something more powerful? Are you sure this is for protection? Yes. Good enough. Yes. Try this puppy on for size. OK. Well, well, well. If it isn't the Greyhound bus driver, who told everyone I took a dump so bad we had to turn the bus around and go back to New Haven. Yeah, I went in there, but I'm not the one who did the paint job. I saw who did it. He was huge, and he looked nothing like me. He was wearing a captain's hat. But you told everybody it was me. Even George Lopez, who was hitching a ride with us because his tour bus broke down. Announce that it wasn't me! Announce it was the man in the captain's hat! This is good. I like this one. If you like this I do. check this one out. Well, well, well. If it isn't the maid at the La Quinta Inn that made such a big deal about what I did to the toilet. I said I would take care of it myself. It didn't have to become a huge screaming match in Spanish in the hall, in front of all the other customers, including George Lopez. And maybe now you won't have the manager make me get in the shower and clean myself off before you consent to clean the toilet. I don't even know why he's allowed to do that! That's good. Oh, man! Did that really happen? No. You know what's cool about this gun? What? You can put a silencer on it. Oh. Yeah! Check this out. This makes it quieter? Yeah. Yeah. Try that. OK. Well, well, well. If it isn't the manager of New Haven's puzzle room. Remember me? I'm the guy who solved all the clues, but you still wouldn't let me out of the puzzle room. And then I accidentally used the fake men's room. And you brought everyone in and showed them, because the fake toilet didn't flush. And then you said, in front of everyone, \"Who does puzzle room by themselves? It's a corporate team building exercise for work colleagues.\" And I said, \"I like puzzles.\" And you said, \"Here's a puzzle, dick weed! Why don't you try to get that real crap out of that fake toilet without getting it all over yourself?\" Yeah, buddy, I never do this but I can't sell you a gun. Sure. I understand. Can I use your bathroom? No. What if I promise not to do a paint job? Get out. OK. See you. Good morrow. May I use your bathroom?",

You got to help him!\" And when you go in there to help him, he just pulls it out easily and laughs 'cause his foot wasn't stuck. It wasn't stuck at all, he was just faking it. And then they get really serious and say, \"It's Turbo time!\" And they both start running around the house as fast as they can and jumping over the couches.

Welcome back. It's been a grueling three months but we've narrowed it down to three chubby little babies. From Salisbury North Carolina Michael Patrick Porkins. From Luverne North Dakota little Taffy Lee Fubbins. And the bad boy of the competition Bart Harley Jarvis. Fuck you Harley Jarvis! Fuck you Harley Jarvis! Get her out! Goddamn it! Judges do you need any more information to help with your decision? I have firmly made up my mind. I would like more information. - I'm a wreck right now. - I understand. This is a hard decision. Let's hear once again from the babies' pediatrician. Baby Porkins is th percentile in weight and th percentile in height. We got a certified chode on our hands. Little tuna can. Baby Fubbins is also th percentile in weight. Ooh! Another chode. Mr. Jarvis is one of the most aggressive babies I've ever met. He has a massive underbite and completely flat back of the head. I hope you fucking die Harley Jarvis! Get... him... out of here! I'm honestly done. I don't want to read anymore. Yeah. Don't let it ruin your day okay? You're still a great doctor. All right judges do you need more time? It's Porkins by a mile. The button nose the apple cheeks... He's the best baby. If Taffy Lee Fubbins isn't the Best Baby of the Year I'll kill myself on live TV. Stop saying that. All right that... That's it. I have to get this off my chest. \"Earlier today when I was waiting to use the private bathroom I witnessed Michael Patrick Porkins' father performing oral on the mystery judge of the competition.\" \"I've been conflicted about whether to say anything because I feel like Michael Patrick Porkins could win it even without the oral. His father didn't need to do the oral.\" And that is why this is so tough... for me to tell about the oral. Oh man that's a bummer. Might fuck this whole thing up. While the judges make their decision let's watch our In Memoriam segment. Oh no. Calm down they're old ones. They don't stay babies forever idiot. Fucking stupid asshole. Little Denny Doo Dinkins respiratory failure. Shirley Cratsworth Shane car crash. In Memoriams don't usually include how they died. Shut up. Little Jeffy Jeremy throat slashed. God. Someone get her! She's trying to get Jarvis! All right you know what? This is dumb. Dump it. Trash it. This one's garbage. Tiny Dinky Daffy pancaked by drunk dump truck driver.",

      "Maybe I'll go for this. That could be a good one. Is this you? Yeah. Oh my... This is perfect. Babe we were just talking about how we needed a new salt and pepper shaker set. Remember this? Thank you. This is incredible. I'm so glad you like it. There's a gift receipt in case you want to get something that's... Won't need it 'cause this is perfect. Thank you. Happy birthday. Thank you. That one's mine. I forgot to put my name on it. Cool all right. Cool. Yeah it's a wreath. The guy at the store said he has the same one. He said it works great. Thank you so much Lev. Yeah there's a gift receipt in there if you want to exchange it for something that's more you. Okay cool. Thanks. But you like it? I like it Lev. Great. Then give me back the receipt. What? Prove it. You said you like it. Give me back the gift receipt. You don't need it anymore. Lev he likes the gift. Then he doesn't need the gift receipt. I'm just gonna put all this stuff together in the same pile over here if that's cool? Okay. Ooh! I think I know who this is from. If you love it as much as you say you do and as much as you have been saying... then it shouldn't be a problem if I take the receipt back. Okay. Yeah. Here you go. Jesus. Glad you like it. Happy birthday. Thanks. Um let... Let me open... Who...? Oh that one's ours. All right. Are you seriousFirefighter pugs? Honey we got to put this up on our fridge. This is incredible! We just thought it was cute. And you'd be fine if I ate it? Huh? The gift receipt. You'd be fine if I ate it? Why would you eat it? You said you liked the gift. So you wouldn't have any qualms if I ate the gift receipt and it didn't exist anymore. Right RickRight Melissa? Uh... I don't have any qualms. You can eat it if you like. Awesome. Down the hatch bon appétit. Should we open another gift? Ye... Yes. Yes. Uh okay how about this one? I think I know what's in this one. Oh whoa! Hey! I just heard an interview of this guy! This is so interesting. Thank you. I hate to do this but I'm afraid our gracious host didn't wipe properly. What are you talking about? When you went to the bathroom earlier to do the mud pie... you must have used too small of a slice of toilet paper when you wiped and you got mud pie on your hands and then you touched the receipt and then I ate the receipt and now I'm sick off of your mud pie. What the hell are you talking about? You're probably sick 'cause you ate paper you fricking psycho. No I eat paper all the time! What I don't like to make a habit of doing is eating mud pie! Why do you even eat paper?! That doesn't even make sense! Okay you guys calm down! This is insane! There's a simple solution to this. Jacob hasn't touched my gift receipt because he likes my gift. So we just have someone else eat my gift receipt and see if they get sick. But it can't be Jacob 'cause he's gonna pretend he's not sick even if it's caked in pure shit. I'll do it. I'll eat the receipt to solve the problem. And Jacob doesn't touch it! That's right. And if Melissa gets sick then that means that paper makes you sick. But if Melissa doesn't get sick then that means Lev ate the mud pie. There is no mud pies okay? And I genuinely like the gifts. Swear to fucking God? Yes. Then let my wife eat the fucking receipt. Oka... Okay. I am now sanitizing my hands. I have not gone to the bathroom yet today. I took a shower last night after I took a piss and shit. Now... someone hand me the receipt. Jacob don't you get anywhere near that! How you doing honey? I feel... fine. Paper doesn't make you sick on its own. He used too small a piece. Lev's probably not even sick! He's probably faking it! You son of a bitch! Jacob was lying about the mud pie. And if he was lying about something as simple as grabbing too small a slice that probably means he doesn't like the gift either. Exactly! But you liked my gift right Jacob? Yes! What about Rick and Melissa's? You piece of shit! Rick! Fuck! Somebody call . Oh my God. Tell 'em to send an ambulance. Tell 'em it's... the ugly house on Kenmore. The one where you can see the KFC sign through their front window. Happy birthday... No! -...to you... Don't let Jacob touch that! Everybody let's get out of here. This place is covered head-to-toe in shit. All you had to do... was like the gift... and not have a big old mud pie on the bottom of your butt. It's not a big deal. You had a big mud pie you had too small of a slice then I ate the mud pie now my stomach's absolutely fucked. Shouldn't have had such a sloppy mud pie. Get off me man. Fine! Nobody likes your house anyway. You should know... your wife kissed me on the cheek when I got here. Now look at you... all alone. Everybody's going to party at my house. Happy birthday Jacob. I just... I was just trying not to use a ton of paper towel. I just hope Lev's all right. Okay you guys I've got Lev in my car so just follow us. Lev what's your address?",

Yeah I was doing this all the time and the wear and tear was wrecking my regular shirts. But TC Tuggers has this little knob on the front so you don't wreck your shirt or hurt your hand. Yeah that makes sense. Yeah you know what I mean? 'Cause when you go through the day your shirt gets kind of bunched up so I was wrecking my shirts 'cause I was pulling them out subconsciously but this has that knob so you can just do it easily. Awesome. Well we'll get to class. But they're not a joke. What? You don't make jokes about 'em TC Tuggers. You don't wear 'em as a joke you don't give 'em as a joke gift or wear them ironically or do pub crawls in 'em like the Snuggie. They're not like the Snuggie. Do they come in other styles?

Tonight we honor the life and the music of Mr. Herbie Hancock and if we're lucky we might even get him to come up here and play a little music for us. But first I do want to say just for anyone who's concerned I don't think the dog that bit me should get put down. I know that's protocol when a person falls and a dog bites them the dog gets put down but I don't think the dog should get put down because I know that's a service dog. Otherwise why would it be allowed in here and why would it be wearing that little blue shirt? Okay I just wanted to say that so it didn't cloud the rest of the evening. The year is on the mean streets of Chicago. My dog didn't bite you. What? My dog didn't try to bite you. It didn't what? He was trying to hump your head. It tried to bite me. It tried to bite the back of my hair off. It was humping you dude. Uh Okay Herbie can play. Herbie can compose. Herbie sees music in a I'm sorry. I'm sorry but uh What do you even have? What? What do you even have that you have a service dog that's allowed in here? That's really none of your business. That would be true if your dog didn't try to bite the back of my hair off. You know what happened. I don't. And it's too bad we can't figure it out 'cause nobody has video or anything. I took a video. Oh fine. There's no way to watch it. Tech guy can plug it in right there. Yeah! Thanks Herbie. Cool. All right. Okay here I am. Here I am. I'm walking up the stage. There I trip a little on the stair. And here comes a dog trying to bite me. It's It's trying to bite me! It's trying to rip my hair out. What are you laughing at? Oh my God! Are you saying that your dog has blue balls now? You said it humped me. Well it certainly didn't finish 'cause look. It's dry. And you know what? You don't tape people. What is this society that we tape everything? What's going on? Do we not live in the moment anymore? We just tape everything from a phone? I don't like that. You know that's what Herbie's music is against. I don't know man I think the dog humped you. That's why I love Herbie Hancock. He loves to lie.",

Maybe go up to the table and just say like \"Hey stop that.\" Or like \"Hey that's not allowed.\" You want me to go over and say \"Stop eating the meat on the chips\"? No just say the restaurant has a rule. It's not you it's a rule the restaurant has that if you get an item to share you can't One person can't just eat all the fully loaded ones. Like don't look around find the one with most meat and always eat that one. Can't you just ask her to share with you? Can't you just say the restaurant has a rule?

I went up there to ask if we could switch tables. There's an air conditioner above this table and I was worried you were gonna get cold. There's no vent above us. What? Did he ask you to come over and say that about the nachos? He did. What? I went up there to complain about the rule. You just learned the rule! What? He just came over here Who? Him!

So we're gonna have hors d'oeuvres and then mini pizzas shared salads and of course little cupcakes with baby Debbie's name written on them. That's perfect. Christine is gonna love that. This is gonna be such a nice baby shower! Oh we should do like a little gift bag for everybody. That's a great idea. How much do we want to spend? I think maybe around $ makes sense. Oh maybe we could give everybody little individual bottles of champagne. Oh that's a good idea. People also love those macarons. You know? So good. Yeah what about Stanzo brand fedoras? What? Stanzo brand fedoras in each of the gift bags. Those Stanzos are nice. I mean I don't know about fedoras for a baby shower though. They're nice. For $ I could probably get Stanzo brand fedoras. Yeah I don't think we're gonna do the fedoras. You know what's cute that I saw on Etsy? Little baby-toed flip-flops. Oh! Or what about like a little candle? Oh that's cool. Or what about a thousand plastic meatballs? To put in the gift bags? Yeah. They don't go bad or stink or nothing. For $ I could probably get a thousand plastic meatballs. Maybe we should keep thinking. Okay. Oh I know. What about like one of those little things with soaps and lotions from Bath & Body Works? Oh I like that. You know what I saw once I thought was cute? Tommy guns. My friends aren't gonna buy the crap from your mob movie. What mob movie? It fell apart 'cause it fucking sucked. Goddamn it. You brought it up. I didn't. I didn't even know you still had that stuff. Where would it be? Nobody wants a thousand plastic meatballs! They don't even look real! They look like little pieces of shit! You just said they look real. To them. I need to unload them. These are my friends! They They look They look real. They don't look like little pieces of shit. We won't do the meatballs. You're blowing it. We're doing the candles. Yeah. We're gonna do individual little bottles of champagne. And then if we have any money left over Fifty black slicked-back-hair wigs. What are you saying? Fifty black slicked-back-hair wigs. Fifty black slicked-back-hair wigs. How much money did you put in this? I thought it was gonna be a hit! It turns out it fucking sucks! Maybe we could buy a few fedoras. It's got I It's got You kinda got to buy 'em in bulk otherwise it's not worth it for me. So we have to buy all of them? It needs to be quality on my end otherwise no fucking deal. Oh my God these stink! They're Stanzos. They're nice. Hey! Who took my cigars? Who took my cigars?",

Any of these fuckers ever fucking fall out of the ceiling and just have a big messy shit? I don't have an answer for you Or have a dingleberry. I have a question. When people see Eliza and Henry what are they wearing? Okay that's a great question. We find apparitions are most commonly wearing the clothes they died in. Oh yeah do they ever just fuckin' run around nude and you see one of their big old fuckin' hairy nuts? Can I talk to you for a second? Excuse me. Yeah come with me. Look I'm glad you're having fun. It's interesting the ghosts. But you're ruining the tour. It's the adult tour. It's not for kids. I work really hard at what I do and you're totally insulting it.

Exactly to the day three years later just as she predicted it. And the only witness? The exact same Charles Croft who had seen her mother's fall. Does anybody have any questions? Not trying to be funny not trying to get a laugh. I don't want anybody to have the worst day at their job But do any of these fuckers ever blast out of the wall and have like a huge cum shot? No they don't. Okay. Cool. I just asked you not to do this. You can't change the rules just 'cause you don't like how I'm doing it. Can we or can we not swear? Yes. I'm not changing any rules. Big fat load of cum then. I'm just asking you to use a little more judgment when you talk. I don't know what is going on but somewhere our wires got crossed. You're saying we're allowed to swear. I'm saying \"big fat load of cum\" and \"horse cock\" and you're getting mad. Do you see where I'm like Look I've had enough okay? You're done. I just You're done.

You didn't like your meal. It's no big deal. Let me take a video of you saying you're going to kill the president. What? It's no big deal. No one's ever going to see it unless I hear the story of me housing Dylan's burger down at Graham's Lorelai Lounge. We're not saying that. Saying what? That we'll kill the president. Oh shit. Say it again. What is wrong with you? I tried to get a video but I couldn't flip it fast enough. We were really looking forward to seeing you tonight. We look up to you so much but right now I don't even know what to think. The truth is I may look like I have it all but inside I'm just a scared little boy who never learned how to ask for people's food or their burger. And the thing that scares me the most is that if people found out my wife would go to jail 'cause every night a little boy goes down on her. Jesus. Fuck. Christ!",

      "Hey AOL blast viewers. It's me it's your boy Wesley Fillmore sitting down with the cast of Lamador Pictures' latest action flick Detective Crashmore. This thing is fun. Thank you. Thank you very much. Before we dig in with the tough questions let's meet our guests. Linda Easley who plays Monique Ryan Tanna as the fresh-faced Sergeant Wilkes and of course the man who needs no introduction. You might know him from his other job delivering presents to kids all over the world on Christmas Santa Claus. Santa Didn't anybody tell you anything? I told your producers \"Do not mention Christmas or that I do it at all.\" They told me not to focus on it. And I told them not to mention it at all. If Leonardo DiCaprio was here would you ask him about Christmases around the corner? Would you like me to interview you as an actor? That would be great. That would be fucking great for me thank you. Absolute fucking bullshit. Unprofessional bullshit. It's why no one watches AOL blast. Bullshit. So Santa how would you describe Detective Crashmore? It's a cosmic mix of the action of the 's combined with the exploitation films of the 's but with modern touches. It's hyper-violence but it knows that it is. It's a little bit Tarantino. It's definitely a little bit Michael Mann. It's kind of a cosmic gumbo. It almost moves to the beat of jazz. Great. Yeah Ryan and I would joke on set about it being a cosmic gumbo. But uh Let's talk for a second about the nudity in the film. Was that scary for you as an actor to do? Well the script called for it. It's an important part of Detective Crashmore's journey. What are we ten years old? I've seen every cock on the planet. I've seen everyone naked. I'm sorry you've seen everyone naked? Yeah see if they got tattoos. If they do they get no gift. So if you get a tattoo you don't get anything for Christmas? Not that year. You think getting a tattoo is good? No. Getting a tattoo is not good. I don't care about it but it's not good behavior. I got paid two mil to play Crashmore. How does that money help you? Well it does because that amount is called my quote. That's my rate. So the next film I'm offered they have to pay that same amount. Even if I do a bad job. That means as long as I'm offered even one more movie I could get two more mil. Even if I do a bad job they've got to give me that other two mil. Okay. Great.",

      'Your Honor the defense has tried to claim that their unloading of Qualstarr stock the week before its value plummeted was sheer coincidence a very lucrative coincidence. This text message exchange will prove that they knowingly engaged in insider trading. Miss Hubbell do you recognize these text messages? Yes. And they\'re between whom? Myself and Vincent Alan. Vincent Alan your co-defendant and colleague at Nortrip? Yes. I will now read from these text messages dated April th of this year. Bri "Did you talk to Dan at Qualstarr?" Vincent "He said they\'re laying off people next week." Bri "We need to unload our shares before then." Vincent "I\'m on it." Bri "Be discreet." Vincent "Of course." Bri "Oh my God. Did you see Brian\'s hat?" Vincent "Oh fuck. Ha-ha-ha-ha!" What the hell? Bri "He looks so fucking stupid. I can\'t breathe." Vincent "What the hell even is it?" Bri "It\'s a fedora with safari flaps in the back." Vincent "Holy shit!" "He looks so fucking stupid." No. "Talk later." "I\'ll take care of that thing." Hmm. Sounds like more than a coincidence to me. Miss Hubbell do you recognize these texts? I do. Vincent "It\'s done. I talked to Dan. We\'re good." Bri "Loose ends?" Vincent "We\'re all good about to be way better." Bri Smiley face emoji. Vincent "Did you see Brian\'s hat?" "He\'s still fucking wearing it." What the hell? Bri "Yes I even saw two cubes in his pocket." "I think he has dice but he\'s afraid to show them to anyone." The hell\'s she even talking about? Vincent "L-O-L. That is so sad." Bri "So sad. So sad." "So so so so so sad." Vincent "It\'s so heartbreaking but I can\'t stop laughing." "Tears are literally streaming down my face thinking about his dumb dice." Leave it the fuck alone. Bri "Just wired the money." Vincent "Holy fucking shit!" "Brian\'s hat just got him in huge trouble in a meeting." God damn it! "Mr. Andrews made Brian take off his hat." "He said it was distracting." "He said if anyone disagreed he\'d let Brian keep the hat on." "Nobody said shit dude nobody said shit." Bri "What did he do when Mr. Andrews made him take it off?" Vincent "He took the hat off and he hid his head in his hands." "You could tell he was crying." "He kept saying under his breath \'You can\'t fucking do that.\'" "Then Mr. Andrews said \'What\'s that Brian?\'" "And he said \'Nothing.\'" "And then a minute later he said \'It\'s not a distraction.\'" "\'The guy at the store said I\'m the only guy he\'s ever seen pull it off.\'" "Mr. Andrews asked him how much it cost and he said \'It\'s illegal for you to ask me that.\'" "And Brian said \'I\'m putting the hat back on I don\'t care what happens to me.\'" "Mr. Andrews said \'Just take the hat off Brian.\'" "\'No I\'m not taking the fucking hat off.\'" "Then he stood up and said \'I\'ve never fought for anything in my entire life.\'" "\'I\'m fighting for this hat.\'" "He went to slam his hand down on the table but he hit his water bottle and it spilled all over his laptop." "And then I swear to fucking God he tried to roll the hat down his arm like Fred Astaire but the backflap got trapped around Rick\'s wheelchair and then it took him forever to get the flap out of the wheelchair." "He was fucking beet red." "I thought he was going to have a heart attack." "One of the flaps got wheel grease on it and he said \'What the fuck is all this stuff?\'" "\'You have to grease these wheels?\'" "And Rick said \'Yeah you have to keep the wheels lubricated.\'" "And he said \'Yeah well I\'m not supposed to get grease on this hat.\'" "And Brenda was just sitting there slightly in his way towards the door and as he walked towards her he said \'Move \' and right when he said it he realized he had gone too far." "So he said in a jokey voice \'Who said that?\'" Don\'t do the voice. Objection relevance. Finally. "Dollar sign emoji." Quit fucking with them.',

That's got nothing to do with piss. Excuse me? Those pants come like that with those two little dots. They're really in style right now. Even rappers wear 'em. Don't believe me? Look it up for yourself. Go to calicocutpants com. Calico Cut? Calicocutpants com right now. It's not that big a deal. If you don't believe me go ahead look it up right now. Okay fine. \"Calicocutpants com.\" Oh yeah here it is. They sell pants with little dots on 'em. That's got nothing to do with piss. Oh okay. Sorry. Thought he dropped a few drops of pee. He didn't. That ain't the case here. That ain't piss. That's got nothing to do with piss. Okay. Okay. See ya. Uh thanks but I didn't buy these pants like this. I know. You can't buy those pants. Those pants don't exist. They don't? It's just a website that says that these kinds of pants exist. Wouldn't you agree that's all you need? I don't know. If Glen thinks that they sell those kinds of pants he can't prove that you got piss on your pants or that you just own these kinds of pants. It's the perfect thing. I guess. What happens if you try to buy the pants on that website? They all say they're out of stock. That also makes it seem like it's a hot item. It's the same thing Supreme does wouldn't you agree? I guess. But you gotta give. I'm sorry? You gotta give. Calicocutpants com is completely user funded. That means no banner ads no paywall. It's completely user funded. So you pay to keep it active? It's just like PBS. Anyone can use it but if nobody gives it goes dark. Rick the guy who started this thing he's completely under water. He can't get a grip on this thing. So it's only right if you use something to give right? Yeah. Hey hold that door! Hold that door! Hold that door! Did you give? Oh. Uh hey. No not yet. If people use it and they don't give it could go dark. So one more time it's that we give money to the website to keep it active even though it doesn't actually sell pants? What are you thinking? If people find out they don't sell the pants the whole thing falls apart. What are you doing? So no one can hear they don't sell pants. The whole thing relies on the users giving and the users being discreet about that they don't sell the pants! But you gotta give! I'll give. Jesus! Do it now. I'll do it later. I promise. At least open the tab so I know you won't forget. Calicocutpants com. Yeah. Okay there. I gotta get back to work. Hey everybody it's Rick here from calicocutpants com and I want to thank you so much for giving to our website. And if I'm being honest this thing has completely blown up in my face. This ain't my main gig it's my side gig and I can't really get a hold of this on any end. What is this? This is auto play. Things in my life are not going good. Rick explaining what's happening with the company. Why it's important to give. I'm a dead man walking. I got no time left. I'm only eating burgers the only thing I can afford. How do you turn it down? Put the volume down. It's not working. Try the little \"X\"! Quite simply it's just like PBS. I didn't even ask to use it. But you did use it. It helped you out of a jam with Glen. So now you gotta pay. Hey! Hold that door! Hold that door! Give. Hey Jeff here's that thing you asked for that paper. You gotta give. Man I'm trying to work here. I told Rick you're a man of honor. And I owe Calico Cut Pants a lot. When my wife was in the hospital I was very distracted. I was taking four seconds on a six-second piss and letting the last two seconds straight down my leg. What? And it helped to know I had the trapeze net of the site so I could focus on what I really needed to focus on which is to be there for my wife and answer the questions for the doctors. Like what did she go near? Or on a hike did she walk too close to a tower? Or I don't know not this probably but did she eat a battery? Rick knew I wasn't gonna give that month and he barely hounded me. I'm sorry. What? What was wrong with your wife? She had eaten a battery a little battery like a circle battery like a watch battery. Oh. You gotta give! Hey! If you use something and you don't give Give. To. The system. Hey Debbie what's going on? You wore that dress yesterday. My God. I'm the Rock.

I gotta push him around the party make sure everybody gets to see him. Whose house is this? It's mine. There's no cute restaurants in the neighborhood. What? Look we don't want to insult you but since it was a joke he got the low price point which we now know means at Star Wagon Or Stable of Stars. That you allow them to hit. They're not allowed to hit. Oh right. Yes at that price point yes they are allowed to hit. I'm sorry I don't know what I'm saying. Understanding all of that we were just hoping that maybe there's another version of this where everyone kind of gets what they want. I know it's not your fault. What the fuck are you doing? Who is that? That's my George Kennedy. I brought him here as a perk. Why would I want George Kennedy? I know. That's why he's a perk. And that's also why he can't hit! He can't hit. Carson can hit all the day he wants. Can he hit vases? Uh Yeah he can. I like that they can hit. It's cool. Okay. Thank you. And I think it's great. Thank you so much. Thank you. Is he with you? Busted. That's my George Bush. What the fuck are you doing? You can't hit! Both of you go sit in the wagon. I'd send 'em to a coffee shop or something but there's nothing in this area.

I came here looking for intelligent life and I can tell you right now it ain't at table seven. Oh! They're like \"Huh?\" I came here looking for the perfect specimen to abduct. Hey table three. Uh hard pass. Oh! \"Hard pass.\" Brutal. That is nuts. Anyways my friend Bruce is going through the same thing that your sister's going through. Guy had everything. Look at table five. She's thinking \"I should've swiped left.\" Not right now buddy. Okay. If this date were a movie it'd be Bore of the Worlds. You have no clue. Talk about abduction someone abducted all the fun from this date. Her sister's addicted to drugs. Okay? Does that sound boring to you? What? That's what we're talking about. It's okay. I'm sorry if that's the most boring thing you've ever heard that she's scared because her sister loves drugs so much that she can't stop taking them! I didn't know. Exactly. You know nothing about her. This woman's been through absolute hell. Just to get school supplies her mom had to drink puke for a local morning radio show. Did you know that? What? She knew that every little pencil she broke her mom had to take another big gulp of vomit for the Davy and Rascal Show. Does that sound boring to you? She did it more than once? She had a standing invitation. And the listeners loved it when she drank stuff. And she did it for us just so we could get school supplies and trips to Florida. Does that sound boring? No. I'm sorry if the most boring thing you ever heard is my mom drank puke for trips to Florida. One time she drank a jar full of mucus just so she could get a backpack. Right? Yeah. Oh my God. She drank diarrhea. No she didn't. Thought you said that. Could've sworn you said it in the car. No. Look. I was joking when I said you were boring. You said I'm boring? No no no. I watched my daddy get executed by the state for homicide dude. What? Right before they zapped him he looked me right in the eyes and at the top of his lungs he screamed \"Never let the party die!\" Does that sound like a boring guy to you? It doesn't. You have no clue what people have gone through or who they are. So don't say I can't please a woman. I didn't say that. You said I should have swiped left. You did. What's that supposed to mean? I didn't say anything about that. It's all right. All you gotta do is take your head out of that head and come over here and apologize to us face to face. Anyways let's just try to have a good time. I'm gonna get some mozzarella sticks. That sounds good. They have terrific soup. I'm sorry. Who the fuck are you? I'm that. Oh! Oh okay. Yeah. Well okay. In retrospect I can appreciate that you may not have had any idea that we were here talking about how her sister is addicted to drugs. I can barely hear anything out here. Right. Yeah I bet. Sweetie you got a little Mars cocktail on your beautiful gray dress there. Could we get that for free? What? The Mars cocktail. Could we get it for free 'cause she spilled a bit on her dress? Sure. Great. 'Cause if you said no I would've gone home and got on Yelp and said that I found a LEGO head in my corn. I've done that to a lot of places. It works.",

Do you understand the tables are my corn? Whoa! Wow. Pretty serious. Any questions? Yeah. What was her job? Tables. What do you mean? Guys what did I say? Her job is so confusing. The job isn't important. It's just a generic job that the writers of this made up for this. But what is the generic job? Just tables. And dealing with Eddie Munster.

All right I'm gonna show you a whole new video and I want you to tell me what the person in the video did right or wrong. It's the same woman. I just got screamed at by Freddy Krueger. All I said was \"What did you do to my table?\" \"It's filthy. You should be ashamed of yourself.\" \"You're a fucking pig.\" And that's when he snapped. I thought he was gonna kill me.

Lot of girls in my class have their ears pierced but I was a little nervous. I'd always wanted earrings but I really don't like needles. I always wanted an earring. But I was so nervous. The night before I made a mess in the bathroom. I had to jump in the tub. But at Claire's they were so nice. They understood I was nervous and made me feel okay. We're going to Florida and I really wanted an earring for Florida. But I was nervous to the point of diarrhea. At Claire's your comfort is our priority. They let my mom sit with me the whole time. I had Jessica she was in college and was really cool. I had Chloe. She was really cool. She stood outside the bathroom and assured me no one could hear the splashes. I know all this already. I am not nervous. I was a little scared I was going to die on the slab. Like my dad. This shit is for babies for little kids. I know this already. God damn it. They had stars they had unicorns. I had such a hard time choosing. A couple of years ago I ordered my wife a Sybian. Hello? Do I have to sit here and watch this whole thing? I know all this already. I'm not nervous at all. Finish the video if you want to get your ear pierced. All right then. Go! Get out of here. Let me watch this. We were just to the point where we were more friends than lovers. All my friends have their ears pierced. Now I do too. It's just another way to express myself. Sometimes I put my dad in JibJab videos so he's alive again. I showed it to my mom. She said \"Where is he?\" This is so boring. I go \"Mom it's not real. It's a JibJab.\" It's just hard. To see the people who cared for you as a baby become a baby themselves. They showed me how to clean my ears so they didn't get infected. They gave me an ice pack to help with the swelling. Life's a fucking funny thing. You know if it's true that when you die you get to go back through your life and relive all the moments for eternity then I want some moments in there where I'm just dying laughing. I fake laugh every day for ten minutes so that when I die and relive life's little moments all I see is happy times. Ain't that the fucking saddest thing you ever heard? I'm sitting in an empty room laughing my ass off to trick my dead self. I had a great life.",

All my friends have their ears pierced. Now I do too. It's just another way to express myself. Sometimes I put my dad in JibJab videos so he's alive again. I showed it to my mom. She said \"Where is he?\" This is so boring. I go \"Mom it's not real. It's a JibJab.\" It's just hard. To see the people who cared for you as a baby become a baby themselves. They showed me how to clean my ears so they didn't get infected. They gave me an ice pack to help with the swelling. Life's a fucking funny thing. You know if it's true that when you die you get to go back through your life and relive all the moments for eternity then I want some moments in there where I'm just dying laughing. I fake laugh every day for ten minutes so that when I die and relive life's little moments all I see is happy times. Ain't that the fucking saddest thing you ever heard? I'm sitting in an empty room laughing my ass off to trick my dead self. I had a great life.",
